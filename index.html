Chelsea and The Early Years: Building Foundations
</h5>

Founded in 1905, Chelsea initially experienced limited success. The club spent much of its early years fluctuating between divisions, striving to establish a strong identity. Their first major trophy, the league championship, came in 1955. This win marked a turning point, bringing newfound respect and momentum. Despite this, Chelsea spent the next few decades in and out of the top ranks, consistently pushing but facing financial and competitive struggles. In the 1990s, the club began to see more stability. Under the management of Glenn Hoddle and later Gianluca Vialli, Chelsea won their first FA Cup in 26 years (in 1997) and made significant strides in European competitions.

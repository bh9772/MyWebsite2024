  <section id="early-years">
    <h5>Chelsea and the Early Years: Building Foundations</h5>
    <p>
      Founded in 1905, Chelsea initially experienced limited success. The club spent much of its early years fluctuating between divisions, striving to establish a strong identity. Their first major trophy, the league championship, came in 1955. This win marked a turning point, bringing newfound respect and momentum. Despite this, Chelsea spent the next few decades in and out of the top ranks, consistently pushing but facing financial and competitive struggles. In the 1990s, the club began to see more stability. Under the management of Glenn Hoddle and later Gianluca Vialli, Chelsea won their first FA Cup in 26 years (in 1997) and made significant strides in European competitions. Their resurgence set the stage for a new era.

    <h6>The Abramovich Era: A New Powerhouse in Chelsea FC</h6>
    <p>
      In 2003, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich purchased Chelsea, bringing unprecedented investment and ambition. Abramovich’s financial backing and vision transformed Chelsea into a powerhouse in English football almost overnight. With funds to attract top talent, the club brought in stars like Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, and Petr Čech, establishing a core group of players that would become club legends. Abramovich’s appointment of José Mourinho in 2004 marked the beginning of Chelsea’s dominance in the Premier League. Known for his tactical acumen and winning mentality, Mourinho led the team to back-to-back league titles in 2005 and 2006. Chelsea’s defensive solidity, combined with attacking power, made them nearly unbeatable. Mourinho’s influence reshaped Chelsea’s identity, instilling a culture of resilience and a thirst for titles.
